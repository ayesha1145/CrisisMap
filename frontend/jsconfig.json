/**
 * File: jsconfig.json
 * Project: CrisisMap – Multi-Disaster Tracker
 *
 * Purpose:
 * --------
 * Configures JavaScript language features and path aliasing for the CrisisMap frontend.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Helps VS Code and build tools understand module imports and directory structure.
 * - Simplifies imports by allowing cleaner path aliases (e.g., "@/components/ui" instead of long relative paths).
 * - Ensures consistent code navigation, autocomplete, and IntelliSense in development.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Works with React + CRACO setup.
 * - Should remain synchronized with folder names in `src/`.
